# VHDL_AngryBird
A project to learn the works of components like PS-2 Mouse, VGA, State Machines using a DE0 board

The aim of the project is to design a simple game
console with a built-in computer game using only
digital logics and digital design. The game should
only use a DE0-board (the game console)
programmed by a USB cable, a PS/2 Mouse and a
VGA_Sync display.
The project outline specified designing a game
inspired by Flappy Bird. Flappy Bird is a side
scroller game where the player controls a bird,
attempting to fly between rows of pipes without
hitting them. The brief also outlined a few changes
that are to be made to this simple game. We should
have life points, different types of obstacles/gifts,
energy consumption for the bird and a level of
difficulty controlled by a switch
